// You are given two strings s and t.
// String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.
// Return the letter that was added to t.



// Example 1:

// Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
// Output: "e"
// Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
// Example 2:

// Input: s = "", t = "y"
// Output: "y"

//pseuedo code//

//create a new empty object//
//loop over each char of first string//
//check condition//
//if the character we are on in object or not//
//if it is not in object set it frequency to 1//
//if it is already in object increment its frequency by 1//
//loop over each char in second string//
//check condition if object has the char we are on or not//
//if the char is in object and it is not less than 0 decrease the char by 1//
//if the char is less than 0 return the char// this char is difference//
